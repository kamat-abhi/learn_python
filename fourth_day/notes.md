# input
- when we take input from users it take and store as string

# condition 

- we can directly write codition like
  - price = 12 if age >= 18 else 8
  - it check if age is 18 then price = 12

# iteration

- iteration tool
  - (for, comprehension)
- iterable object => (lists, file)  its return __next__
- in pyhton file is also a iterable object
- in python we can make itarable using iter()

- # when we store a file inside a veriable and take its reference, then it is an iterable object in itself, but if you have given the name of a list in a memory reference, then it is not its itersted object, it is just a reference to that actual object.

- dist is itterable
